Then set the permissions to 777 for the following directories/files:

- storage/app/
- storage/framework/
- storage/logs/
- bootstrap/cache/
- .env

Next, edit the `.env` file and change the database credentials.

**Note:** Make sure your inside the `pw-web` directory when you run the commands.

The next step is to create all the database tables and default records, run the following command:
